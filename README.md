# Logistic Regression

## Problem Statement: 
### Binary Class Classification to classify suspected FNA cells to benign or malign using Logistic Regression in Python

The task of this project is to perform classification using machine learning for a two class problem. The features used for classification are pre-computed from images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. This project classifies suspected FNA cells to Benign (class 0) or Malignant (class1) using logistic regression as the classifier.
